Matrix. Created by Y * N threads. An integer matrix of dimension NxN was initialized. The name of each stream is a unique integer. Each stream writes its name-number to the matrix diagonal and simultaneously changes one of the elements of the row or column in which the variable diagonal element is located. Only one thread can change a specific element on the diagonal and an element in its row or column. Next, each thread must calculate the sum of all the elements in the row and column with the number of its diagonal. After the first N flows are completed, the matrix and calculation results are written to a file, and the following N flows are allowed to work with the matrix.
